        <p id="a14">Sept. 15, 2022</p>
        <p class="a1">WASHINGTON — A federal judge on Thursday rejected the Justice <br>Department’s request to resume a key part of its inquiry into <br>former President Donald J. Trump’s handling of sensitive <br>government records and appointed an outside arbiter to review <br>thousands of documents seized last month from his Florida <br>residence.</p>
        <p class="a2">The judge, Aileen M. Cannon, declined to lift any part of an order <br>she issued last week barred the department from using the <br>documents, including about 100 marked classified, in its <br>investigation until the arbiter, known as a special master, had <br>completed a review.</p>
        <p class="a3">In her 10-page decision, Judge Cannon appointed a special master <br>suggested by the Trump leg team and agreed upon by the <br>government: Raymond J. Dearie, a semiretired judge from the <br>Federal District Court for the Eastern District of New York.</p>
        <p class="a4">Judge Dearie will now have the authority to sift through more than <br>11,000 records the F.B.I. carted away from Mr. Trump’s estate, Mar<br>-a-Lago, on Aug. 8. The move was a blow to the Justice Department, <br>almost certain to significantly delay its investigation into whether <br>the former president unlawfully retained national defense records <br>or obstructed repeated attempts by federal officials to retrieve <br>them.</p>

Dearie of the Federal District Court in <br>Brooklyn.</a></li><br>
        <li><strong>Access to Sensitive Records:</strong> The same federal judge enacted, and later <br>refused to lift, a temporary ban on the Justice Department’s ability to <br>access classified documents seized from Mr. Trump’s home. On Sept. 16, <br>the agency <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/16/us/politics/trump-special-master-justice-dept.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&module=styln-trump-raid&variant=show&region=MAIN_CONTENT_1&block=storyline_top_links_recirc">asked an appeals court to let the F.B.I. regain access to the <br>documents.</a></li><br>
        <li><strong>Mislading Information:</strong> The National Archives told the Justice <br>Department that a lawyer representing Mr. Trump indicated to the archives <br>last year that boxes the former president had taken to Mar-a-Lago from <br>the White House <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/16/us/politics/archives-trump-classified-clippings.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&module=styln-trump-raid&variant=show&region=MAIN_CONTENT_1&block=storyline_top_links_recirc">included only nonclassified material,</a> according to a <br>person briefed on the matter.</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="a6">Still, Judge Cannon, whom Mr. Trump appointed in November <br>2020, declined to back down on having the special master vet those <br>documents, too — and making the F.B.I. wait, at least for now, to <br>have full access to them in its investigation.</p>
    <p class="a7">In her order, Judge Cannon took pains to describe herself as <br>mindful of the traditional reluctance of the judicial branch to <br>intrude on executive authority in national security matters. But she <br>wrote that her court could not “abdicate its control over questions <br>of privilege and does not find the government’s argument <br>sufficiently convincing as presented.”</p>
    <p class="a8">In naming Judge Dearie as special master, Judge Cannon did not <br>address an issue the Justice Department had flagged in saying it <br>was open to his appointment: As a semiretired judge on senior <br>active status, he occasionally hears cases, and active judges are not <br>supposed to have outside employment.</p>
    <p class="a9">Asked about the possibility of being indicted in the investigation, <br>Mr. Trump told a conservative radio host on Thursday that there <br>would be “problems in this country the likes of which perhaps <br>we’ve never seen before.”</p>
    <p class="a10">The Office of the Director of National Intelligence has also said that <br>after Judge Cannon’s order, it paused its risk assessment and <br>classification review. In her ruling on Thursday, she expressed <br>doubt about whether the government could no longer conduct such <br>an assessment without the criminal investigation proceeding — <br>even as she put forward a very narrow interpretation of her initial <br>order.</p>
