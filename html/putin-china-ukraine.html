        <p class="a2">The discordant messages of China’s president, <br>Xi Jinping, and President Vladimir V. <br>Putin of Russia suggested that despite an earlier<br>Moscow does not have an unconditional ally in Beijing.</p>

        <div class="a5">President Vladimir V. Putin acknowledged on Thursday that China <br>had “questions and concerns” about Russia’s war in Ukraine, a <br>notable, if cryptic, admission that Moscow lacks the full backing of <br<its biggest, most powerful partner on the world stage.></div>
            <div class="a6">Mr. Putin met China’s leader, Xi Jinping, on Thursday in their first <br>in-person meeting since Russia invaded Ukraine, and as Mr. Xi <br>traveled abroad for the first time since the start of the pandemic. <br>But rather than put on a show of Eurasian unity against the West <br>as Russia struggled to recover from last week’s humiliating <br>military retreat in northeastern Ukraine, the two leaders struck <br>discordant notes in their public remarks — and Mr. Xi made no <br>mention of Ukraine at all.</div>
            <div class="a7">“We highly appreciate the balanced position of our Chinese friends <br>in connection with the Ukrainian crisis,” Mr. Putin said in televised <br>remarks at the start of the meeting. “We understand your <br>questions and concerns in this regard.</div>
            <div class="a9">And internationally, as the West continues to ratchet up sanctions <br>against the Kremlin, the Russian president on Thursday saw Mr. Xi <br>— who had pledged a friendship with “no limits” just three weeks <br>before Russia invaded — conspicuously withhold any public <br>support for Mr. Putin’s war.</div>

            <p id="a8">Instead, in a statement issued after their meeting, China said it was <br>“willing to work with Russia to demonstrate the responsibility of a <br>major country, play a leading role, and inject stability into a <br>turbulent world.” To scholars who study the between-the-lines <br>messaging of the Chinese government’s public remarks, it sounded <br>like an implicit rebuke.</p>
            <p id="a9">Accentuating the dissonance, even as Mr. Xi said nothing on <br>camera about Ukraine, Mr. Putin at Thursday’s meeting backed <br>Beijing in its confrontation over Taiwan, where tensions rose last <br>month amid a visit by U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to lend <br>support for Taiwan’s resistance to pressure from Beijing, which <br>claims the self-ruled island democracy.</p>
